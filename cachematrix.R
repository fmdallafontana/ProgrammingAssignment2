## There are cases in programming that When you want to calculate the inverse of a matrix you don't do it just once. In these cases may be useful to cache the result in case you'll need it after, and so reduce  time-consuming computations.


## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
